# A Command Line Based Task Manager

A **command-line tool** that manages tasks for users. This tool allows a user to add,
view, mark as complete, and delete tasks. Additionally, a user can use the tool to check
which tasks are due within the next 2 days. Moreover, the CLI tool allows users to categorize
tasks and designate the important ones. This command line tool, incorporating a colorized and well-formated output, caters to both technical and non-technical users. It can be useful as a task tracking and organization assistant for team leaders charged with assigning duties and responsibilities to juniors, or for personal use.

## Features
- **Adding tasks**: Users can add tasks by providing a task's description, due date, task priority, and, optionally, passing a category in which a task belongs.
- **viewing tasks**: Users can view task entries, which are automatically stored in a csv file when
a task is added. When a user requests to view tasks, various information about each task â€” Description, Due Date, Priority, Category(Tags) and status (Whether completed or not) are displayed
- **Marking completed tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed by simply passing the task's number to a command, and a task with that number will be updated as "Done"
- **Deleting tasks**: For completed tasks, users can choose to delete them by passing in the task number to a command.
- **Task Tagging**: Users can categorize tasks for easier identification by passing a tag to a task when adding the task
- **Friendly Error Messages**: The program is user friendly. It implements error handling mechanisms that displays friendly and easy to understand error messages for non-technical users.
- **Colorized Output Messages**: This tool uses color codes to display different outputs for successful operations and errors.

## How It Works

The tool allows you to pass specific flags from the command line to invoke various task management
functionalities. To use a command, you run the `task_manager.py` script from a terminal, appending a command you wish to execute. You can run `python task_manager.py --help` to view all the available commands.
